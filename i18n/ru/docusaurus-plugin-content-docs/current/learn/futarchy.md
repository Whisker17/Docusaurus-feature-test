Futarchy is a mode of governance. It acknowledges that democratic voting is a
good way to govern, but tries to improve on it. The basic idea is that through
the use of prediction markets as information aggregators, better policy
decisions can be made.

It's easiest to illustrate this new concept through use of example. Let's
consider first a one person organization and how an individual might use
futarchy to govern their own personal decision, and from here we'll expand on
how it works for organizations and how it will work for the Zeitgeist DAO and
other DAOs powered by ZTG.
